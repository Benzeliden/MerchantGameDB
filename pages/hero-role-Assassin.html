Physical attack damage dealer.

The Assassin is very similar to the Rogue. He has slightly lower physical damage in exchange for higher accuracy and 5 additional starting Crit. Like with other high accuracy heroes, the Assassin can obtain the base accuracy requirement easier, allowing him to equip higher damage gear to make up for the lower damage.
