<h1>Item Comparison Tool Help</h1>
<h2>How to use?</h2>

<p>
Browse to gear pages(weapons, armor, and trinkets) and click the “Compare” button. You will be presented with a prompt to confirm adding the item. You also have the option to remove the item from the comparison table. Click the “Confirm Changes” button. Now go to another gear page of the same type and click the “Compare” button. Finally, click on “View Comparison” to be taken to the comparison page.
</p>

<p>
The comparison page will show you the 2 items, side-by-side so you can easily compare the stats between the 2 items.
</p>

<p>
You can share the comparison by using the Copy URL button. This allows you to copy the regular URL format, or to get a Reddit formated link that you can paste right into Reddit.
