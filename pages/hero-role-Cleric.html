Magical attack damage dealer, with high accuracy.

The Cleric has smaller magical attack per intellect than the Mage, but make up for it with higher natural accuracy and higher accuracy from dexterity. This higher accuracy allows them to use higher damage gear that the mage cannot use, and still meet the required endgame accuracy. Because of this, Clerics are usually able to match the Mage's magical attack damage.
